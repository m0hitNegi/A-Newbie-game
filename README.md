# A-Newbie-game
The game is same as the game seen in windows gadgets, the puzzle game.
You are given a board of 15 numbers set randomly across the board.
You have to order all the numbers in the board in ascending order from left to right in each row.

gotoxy() was just a jargon and was not used within the program.
